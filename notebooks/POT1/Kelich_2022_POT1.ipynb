    "The first patient (patient 1, proband pedigree V-1; Fig. 1 A) was a 32-yr-old male referred to our center because of features of interstitial lung disease on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). He had been diagnosed with nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver at age 23. Furthermore, he had portal hypertension with esophagus and fundus varices and splenomegaly with splenic vein thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. His family history was notable for IPF in his father. He had a smoking history of 7 packs/yr. On physical examination, digital clubbing was noted. Pulmonary fibrosis, with a probable usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern, was seen on HRCT, and the patient was given a diagnosis of IPF (Fig. 1 D). He was treated with pirfenidone for 17 mo and switched to nintedanib because of progression of disease and side effects. Treatment with nintedanib was discontinued after 8 mo due to side effects. At age 35, he underwent liver transplantation due to hepatopulmonary syndrome. 6 mo after liver transplantation, treatment with danazol was started. Pulmonary fibrosis was progressive, and 2 yr after liver transplantation, he underwent lung transplantation. Next-generation sequencing on a 36-gene IPF gene panel revealed a heterozygous variant in POT1: c.776T>C; p.(Leu259Ser) (NM015450.2_) and no abnormalities in the other 35 genes on the panel. The L259S variant was inherited from the deceased father with IPF and confirmed to be present in extracted patient fibroblasts with Sanger sequencing (Fig. 1 B). Telomere length in blood showed short telomeres, below the first percentile of controls"
