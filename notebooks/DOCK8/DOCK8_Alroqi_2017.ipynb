    "# Patient P1\n",
    "The index case (patient P1) was a 3-year-old boy born to consanguineous parents (Fig. 1A) who presented at 10 months of age with persistent diarrhea and poor weight gain starting at one year of age that did not respond to multiple dietary modifications. His physical examination was notable for weight below the 5th percentile for age, and an eczematous rash involving his face (Fig. 1B), trunk and extremities. His eczema started at the age of 3 months, and while complicated by intermittent secondary bacterial infections, it responded well to therapy with topical steroids and emollients. His upper gastroenterology endoscopy was normal while his initial colonoscopy showed non-specific colitis for which he was treated with parenteral nutrition and oral steroid. Despite the initial favorable clinical response, his diarrhea relapsed in the setting of negative infectious studies that included routine stool cultures for enteric bacterial pathogens and frequent stool exams for ova and parasites. Testing for other infectious agents, including rotavirus, adenovirus, Clostridium difficile, giardia and cryptosporidium, was negative on multiple occasions. Subsequently, multiple immunosuppressive medications were tried, including pulse steroid, azathioprine and cyclosporine, without sustained clinical improvement. Repeated colonoscopy demonstrated chronic active colitis with diffuse superficial ulceration (Fig. 1C, D). Colonic tissue histopathology showed a diffuse mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells associated with bifid crypts and crypt abscesses (Fig. 1D). These findings were concerning for the possibility of evolving ulcerative colitis for which he was managed with azathioprine and mesalamine. His blood counts revealed a mild anemia with peripheral eosinophilia (Table E1). Evaluation of serum immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG), specific antibody titers and lymphocyte subsets were normal. His IgE levels were elevated (> 5000 Ku/l) and his specific IgE was highly positive for multiple foods including milk, soy, wheat, egg, peanut and tree nuts. Autoimmune workup showed a positive direct Coombs test, consistent with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia, but was negative for anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-thyroid antibodies and celiac disease screening tests. On follow-up he developed a pneumonia complicated by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome leading to his death at the age of 3 years."

    "# Patient P2\n",
    "Patient 2 (P2) is a 4-year-old girl, cousin of patient P1, who presented for evaluation following her cousin’s death. She had a generalized eczematous rash since early infancy. Her eczema was managed successfully with topical steroids and emollients with no history of skin super-infections. At 12 months of age, she started to have multiple ear infections that were treated with multiple courses of antibiotic, and which were eventually controlled by the placement of bilateral tympanostomy tubes. At the age of 3 years, she started to have chronic diarrhea, similar to her cousin’s history. On physical exam, the patient had a generalized eczema and bilateral perforated eardrums. Her complete blood counts, immunoglobulins and tetanus IgG antibody titer were normal (Table E1). Her total IgE was 408 IU/ml, and she had positive specific IgE antibodies to milk, soy, peanut, sesame and tree nuts. Sanger sequencing analysis of DOCK8 identified the same homozygous mutation that was described in P1 (c.1498 C>T; p. R500X), also leading to complete absence of DOCK8 expression (Fig. 1E, F). She was started on antimicrobial prophylaxis and monthly IVIG infusion with good clinical improvement. Currently, the patient is being evaluated for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from her full-matched healthy sibling (23)."

At 5 years of age, she developed chronic diarrhea in the setting of negative infectious studies. Multiple antimicrobial medications were tried without sustained clinical improvement. Her upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy showed eosinophilic esophagitis, chronic inactive gastritis and chronic colitis with an eosinophilic infiltrate (Fig. 3A, B). Subsequently, she was started on oral steroid and mast cell stabilizer with resolution of her diarrhea and significant weight gain. Evaluation of serum immunoglobulins, specific antibody titers and lymphocyte subsets were normal apart from high IgE (> 5000 Ku/l) (Table E1).
